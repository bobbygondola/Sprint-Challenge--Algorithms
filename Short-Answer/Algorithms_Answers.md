#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear O(n) - While loop but simple n operations


b) Linearithmic O(n log n) - Nested loop n * log n


c) Linear O(n) - Simple, time completity increases with increased # of inputs

## Exercise II

The best way we can go about finding the point of breakage is a Linear Search Strategy.
We can start from the bottom floor and incrementing floor by floor to find our answer.
The runtime of a Linear Search Strategy is...

BEST CASE = O(1) WORSE CASE = 0(n)
